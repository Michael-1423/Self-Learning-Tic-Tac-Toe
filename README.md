First the ttt.py file contains all the functions necessary to play tic-tac-toe, this includes a function to play a move and functions to check for win or draw.
The model training is done in #Self learning tic-tac-toe.py, where we train the model on easy (Explore) and hard (exploit) modes randomly and receive points based on win/draw/loose or 1/0/-1.
The tic-tac-toe-test.py uses the model training in above file to play in a real environment.
